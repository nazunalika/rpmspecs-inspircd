 When you are done you can run the following command to start InspIRCd:
 
-	@BINARY_DIR@/inspircd
+	systemctl enable inspircd.service --now
 
 If you have installed from an official package you may need to prefix this
-command with `sudo -g @GROUP@ -u @USER@` to run as the correct group/user.
+command with `sudo` if you are not the root user. Be sure to check the
+status of the service for errors:
+
+	systemctl status inspircd.service
+	journalctl -u inspircd.service
 
-You can also use one of the helper scripts in `@SCRIPT_DIR@`.
