rpmspecs-inspircd
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the RPM spec files that I have created for inspircd. I am not affiliated with the inspircd project and only provide this as a service.

I'm still trying to figure out why I'm even packaging this anymore, considering the fact the developers like to reinvent the wheel over and over again.

Anyway, if you're still here, please note: **I cannot guarantee support on this build. You are free to open issues, but understand that I may or may not be able to resolve the issues. I started adding this build again due to an email request.**

**With that said, you are on your own.**
